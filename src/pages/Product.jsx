                The scope of the utility Privatir will provide you is narrow by
                design: provide a single interface to collect, organize and
                eventually reference investor inquiries and the breadcrumbs of
                information typically lost in the unread email vortex. Act when
                YOU are ready.

                  Privatir aims to stand between you and what at times feels
                  like a ceaseless onslaught.
