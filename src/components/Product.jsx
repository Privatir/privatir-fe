              The scope of the utility Privatir will provide you is narrow by
              design: provide a single interface to collect, organize and
              eventually reference investor inquiries and the breadcrumbs of
              information typically lost in a sea of unread emails — when YOU
              are ready

              Like the sentry posted on the watchtower, Privatir aims to stand
              between you and what at times feels like a ceaseless onslaught.
